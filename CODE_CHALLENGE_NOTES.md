# Things I thought were cool

1.  ** The address fuzzy autocorrect was pretty useful.  It validated the address and came back with the lat/long coordinates.
2.  ** The weather API was pretty useful.  It came back with the forecast data in a format that was easy to parse.

## Things I thought I did correctly

1.  ** I used the right right weather API, eventually**
2.  ** I used conventional git commit messaging**
3.  ** I adhered to enterprise-level production-ready best practices including:
** Thoughful comments on code and documentation **
** Clear README with setup instructions
** At least 2 clear and concise commit messages
** breaking methods apart that do too many things in to smaller methods
** using environment variables for sensitive information
** using a database for persistent storage
** using a service object to handle complex business logic
** Wrote RSpec tests for the application

## Things I did wrong

1.  ** I got on a roll and I was running out of time so my commit history is nothing short of unacceptable. That's not how I commit. It just turned in to a slaughterhouse for a second.

2.  ** I started using a react frontend and halfway through that I realized I was fighting the rails 7 framework so I switched to Stimulus.js (sort of native to rails 7).  That ended up leaving a bunch of residual react code in the codebase and I had to deal with that.**

3.  ** It was only when I was finished with the project that I remembered Apple has Maps.  My dumb ass just threw Google Maps Api in there because...we all have regrets.**


## To wrap it up...
It was a tight timeline, a thoughtful code challenge, and a hell of an opportunity to show my skills.  I'm looking forward to the next opportunity to show my skills.
